**USAGE:**

`<?php if (function_exists('get_mostpopular')) get_mostpopular(); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* *My Popular Posts are being displayed with no formatting*

If you activated the option "Use custom HTML Markup", make sure you have filled in all fields and try again.

* *Thumbnails are not being displayed.*

Please make sure that: 1) your current host is running PHP 4.3 or higher, 2) your host has the GD library installed, 3) the cache subfolder (wordpress-popular-posts/scripts/cache/) is *writable* (chmodd it to 777 if you're unsure about this), and 4) your popular posts has images to display.

* *I'm getting a "Sorry. No data so far." message. What's wrong?*

Patience, my friend. One of two things is happening here:

1) (and more likely) Wordpress Popular Posts has not registered any views yet. Each time someone views your posts WPP will notice it (except when it's you). If you're getting this message it's because no one has checked your posts yet. Give it some time.

2) If you're using the code snippet, remember that it must be placed either in sidebar.php (usually it should be put in there), or in footer.php, or in header.php. Generally speaking, putting it somewhere else will prevent Wordpress Popular Posts from working as expected.

* *I've got posts with better stats (comments, pageviews, etc.) than those listed by your plugin. What's happening?*

Every time a post is viewed by someone (except you), it is registered by *Wordpress Popular Posts* and its pageviews count is updated automatically. Chances are that it has not been viewed by anyone since you installed *Wordpress Popular Posts* on your blog - so don't worry, *Wordpress Popular Posts* will take note of it once someone checks any of your posts.

* *How can I style the small tag where comments count, pageviews, etc. (the "stats tag") are displayed?*

I have included a small stylesheet file called wpp.css that you can use to style the **stats tag** to your liking.

* *I would like to help translate Wordpress Popular Posts into my language. What do I need to do?*
